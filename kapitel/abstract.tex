\chapter{Abstract}
Due to the amount of ontological levels that Melanee offers, it is possible to illustrate and verify relationships and interaction between various entities of a system. This ability of Melanee can be used for describing different object types in a game and make it possible for a user to describe a playable level by choosing and inserting an object from a set of objects.  Model-driven game development approaches where models are prioritized to lead the game development process are becoming an arising paradigm, due to prototyping and testing being recognized as significant steps in game design. This thesis deals with the model-driven software development of levels in a two dimensional platformer game, where various entities like player characters, enemies, and level objects can be placed and modified, regarding their relationship with each other.
